    "\n",
    "You are going to generate episodes of a simple game called *MiniPoker*. There are two players in the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are as follows.\n",
    "- Both players add an *ante* of size 1 to the stakes to begin the game.\n",
    "- Then the 'cards' are dealt. The players could only see their own hands.\n",
    "- The hands are assumed to be real numbers between 0 and 1. Player 1's hand is the realization $u$ of a standard uniform variable $U$ on the interval $[0,1]$. Player 2's hand is the realization $v$ of a standard uniform variable $V$ on the interval $[0,1]$. The variables $U$ and $V$ are independent.\n",
    "- After seeing her/his hand, player 1 can choose between *passing* and *betting*. If he passes, a *showdown* follows immediately. The players compare their hands in the showdown, and the player with the highest hand wins the pot. *Betting* means adding an extra amount 1 to the stakes.\n",
    "- After a bet by player 1, player 2 can decide to *fold* or to *call*. If she/he *folds*, she/he loses her/his *ante* of 1 to player 1. To *call*, player 2 must put an extra amount 1 in the pot. In that case, a *showdown* follows, and the player with the highest hand win the pot."
